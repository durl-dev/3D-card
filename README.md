# 3D-card
A 3d card that can be used for a portfolio website, as a virtual business card, or other applications. 

# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This project showcases skills in HTML as well as CSS. There are simple things such as colors, borders, padding, margin, etc. as well as some more intermediate elements like simple animations using translation delays and manipulating positions. 

# Takeaway

I learned how to make this with coddy.tech. I learned a bit regarding all the animation elements in this project. I had already known how to write HTML and CSS and could already handle things like hovering, but was very excited to dive into basic animations and making something look 3d without having to use a 3d environment. Very excited to apply these newly learned skills to future projects.
